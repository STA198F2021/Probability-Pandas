## Background: Screening for Chronic Disease

We found several studies revealing that obtaining a screening test for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, colon cancer, and cervical cancer would reduce a patient's risk of mortality by his or her chronic disease. For example, the American Cancer society conducted a study to observe the effects of mammogram screenings on the prevalence of advanced and fatal breast cancers. The study found that women who received breast cancer screening had a statistically significant 41% reduction in their risk of having a fatal breast cancer case and a 25% reduction in the rates of having advanced breast cancer. This study suggests that receiving a screening can decrease the likelihood of having a fatal or worsened case of breast cancer.

- The goal of this report is to analyze how lack of access to health insurance affects peopleâ€™s access to chronic disease screening. 

---

## Research Question

How does lack of access to health insurance correlate to the prevalence of screening for various chronic diseases?

---

## Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that decreased lack of access to health insurance prevalence is correlated to increased screening for chronic diseases in various cities. Inversely, we also hypothesize that increased lack of access to health insurance prevalence is correlated to decreased screening for chronic diseases in various cities.

- Null Hypothesis: The lack of health insurance has no effect on the number of chronic disease screenings in various cities.

- Alternate Hypothesis:  The lack of health insurance has an effect on the number of chronic disease screenings in various cities.

```

We created a Logistic Regression Model because we wanted to model the binary outcome of whether or not individuals in a certain city were getting checkups or not. 

Model 1: Without Interaction
$$log(\frac{\pi_{i}}{\pi-1})=\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*Region + \beta_{2}*CitySize + \beta_{3}HealthInsurance$$
Model 2: With Interaction
$$log(\frac{\pi_{i}}{\pi-1})=\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*Region + \beta_{2}*CitySize + \beta_{3}HealthInsurance + \beta_{1}*Region*CitySize +$$

$$\beta_{2}*Region*HealthInsurance + \beta_{3}CitySize*HealthInsurance$$

## Discussion

- Impact of Different Regions on Predicted Checkups
- Impact of Different City Sizes on Predicted Checkups
- Impact of HI on Predicted Checkups

---

## Limitations

- Unequal number of cities for each city size
- Data set only includes 500 largest cities in the US
- Other significant predictors that are not included in this particular dataset

---

## Potential Implications

- Suggestions for further research: Why are cities in the West less likely to have a high prevalence of checkups?
- Results of the model as it pertains to prevalence of lack of health insurance: Increased prevalence of health insurance is correlated to greater amount of checkups per capita, and therefore to increased prevalence of screening for various diseases.
- Mortality: Studies show link from increased screening to decreased mortality.
- Lowered mortality rates may be achieved with greater prevalence of health insurance.
